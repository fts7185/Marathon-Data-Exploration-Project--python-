# Marathon Data Exploration Project (python)
 Data clean up, exploration and visualization.

 Welcome to one of my projects completed while studying at Santa Clara University, specializing in data science and business analytics. This project was completed in python with pandas, seaborn, and sklearn. 

 The basic premise of this project was to get any dataset, prepare the data, do some exploratory analysis, create some findings and represent them via a few basic data visualization methods. Finally, we had to apply Machine Learning methods. 

 I chose the Hong Kong Marathon result data from Kaggle set as I personally love long distance running and thought it might be helpful in any of my training to understand the results around marathon level athletes. The project was a great exercise to model the steps of methods required to take data from its raw state and represent it in a useful way. Plus we got to include some advanced statistic methods (like dummy variables) and Kmeans machine learning method.

 Hope you enjoy!
